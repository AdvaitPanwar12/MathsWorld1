<p> Addition is basically adding of numbers using your fingers, doing it in a paper etc. Addition can be useful in real life as it is needed for day to day calculations. <br>
        Lets take this for a example-  1 Apple + 1 Apple ( Keep in Mind that this sign (+) called plus is used for addition purposes.) So here, we can see that 1 apple is being <br>
        added to one more apple. If you take one apple in your hand and your mother gives you one more, then you will have 2 apples. Now you can see that the number <br> 
        increases as we move forward. Now this was only 1 apple and 1 apple. Now think you have 2 oranges and your father gives you 2 oranges more. You will have <br>
        4 apples as 2 more are added. Now lets see how we can do it in paper. </p>
 
 <p>    2  + 2 = 4  </p>
